// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a = num1
b = num2

sum = a + b  



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

input = num
if num / 2
print (it's even)
else 
print (it's odd)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
avg = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5)/5
min = n1
max = n1
for i = 2 to 5
 if n1 > n2 then:
   small = n1
 if n1 < n2 then:
   large = n1
print ("Average", avg)
print ("minimum", min)
print ("maximum", max)

average = all numbers added together and then divide by total of numbers added (5)

find if numbers are smallest or largest by putting them in order. after reordering n1= min, n2 =max
smallest = min
largest = max
